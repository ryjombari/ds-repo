## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## scatterplot
```{r bw}
g <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
g + geom_point()
# summary(cars)
# data()
```

```{r color}
g + geom_point(aes(color=class))
```

```{r shape}
g + geom_point(aes(shape=class))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
